#Outputs from ASD_Cellchat_Script4#

From Script 3 we get genes involved in dysregulated interactions. Therefore using these genes we run two enrichment approaches. 

First one is a GO overlap. In which all genes are used for enrichment using GO gene sets. Our genes are not ranked or anything. That is why is called an overlap analysis. 

I get a dot plot from this analysis.

Second approach consist on seeing if these genes are also enriched in genes already known to be involved in Neuro developmental disorders. For that I created an excel file in which there are listed genes related to those disorders. Here using fisher test we run the enrichment analysis.

The output is a dot plot as well.
